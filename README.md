## Keras

Referenced from: [https://keras.io/](https://keras.io/).
Keras is a high-level neural network API. It is written in python and is able to run <em>TensorFlow</em>. It focuses on fast experimentation and being able to go from idea to result in the shortest possible time so that research does not get bogged down

Keras Has four guiding principles, <em>User Friendliness, Modularity, Easy Extensibility and to Work with Python<em>.

**User Friendliness**: Keras is designed to be used by humans and is focused around user experiences. It offers consistent and      simple APIs. It reduces the amount of actions required form the user for common use cases. It also provides clear feedback on any errors from the user.

**Modularity**:
